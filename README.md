## **SMS messages status**

### Received message
- UNREAD: message has never been read on the gateway
- READ: message has already been read on the gateway

### Sent message
- NEW: new created message, not transfered yet to the Android device
- PUSHED: message pushed to the Android device
- PENDING: message is pending in the Android device
- SENT: message has been sent to the gateway's network
- DELIVERED: message has been received by the recipient's phone
- FAILED: message delivery has failed and will not be retried
- MISSING: message with this message id is missing, no state available

## **Online demo**
A full working gateway implementation is available here : 

- [Production Hosting](https://sms.bitmutex.com/). 
- [Fallback](https://1-2-3-4-5-6.net/smsgateway/). 

Click the link and everything is self-explanatory. You will simply have to install and configure the companion open source Android app in order to send and receive SMS messages through this demo gateway (as explained after sending a first SMS message using the online demo gateway).  
When sending a message, the following information will be returned in the http header and in the html meta tags:
- X-SMSGateway-State: state of the sent message (NEW|FAILED)
- X-SMSGateway-State-Url: full url to check the state of the message
- X-SMSGateway-Message-Id: message id

## **Documentation**
-The main library code is [here](./src/Pulsebridge.php) see code for documentation.

-The render/view code is [here](./src/PageRenderer.php) see code for documentation.


## **Android specific parameters**
Using adb shell, you should change these two parameters:
- sms_outgoing_check_max_count
- sms_outgoing_check_interval_ms

Example for a limit of 200 messages per minute:

```
adb shell
settings put global sms_outgoing_check_max_count 200
settings put global sms_outgoing_check_interval_ms 60000
```
